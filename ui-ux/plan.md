## 1: Problem statement

Define the problem to solve, i.e. Little Lemon site needs a table reservation feature.

### Statement

Little Lemon requires a capability for customers to make reservations using the mobile version of their website.

The customers who will use this feature are typically wanting a fast and convenient booking system that will allow them to ensure a place in this popular cafe, especially at busy times. As a local favourite for social gatherings, it should support possibly large groups, and have minimal steps.


## 2: Persona

Represents the target market.

(Need to show research informing this?)

## 3: Journey map

Represents the user journey of target market.

(Need to show research informing this?)

E.g. [https://www.coursera.org/learn/principles-of-ux-ui-design/supplement/K5M9u]

## 4: Wireframes

Low-fidelity.

At least two wireframes.

Define features and functionality.

(Do the related exercise but adapt content for this assignment?)

E.g. [https://www.coursera.org/learn/principles-of-ux-ui-design/supplement/lv2q0/solution-create-wireframe-in-figma]

## 5: Prototype

High fidelity.

Interactive.

Consider all best practices (make a list from course summaries?)

At least two interactive components such as button and radio buttons (see related exercises)

Link pages together, from reserve table button on home screen to another screen.

Home screen and style guide Figma file is provided.
